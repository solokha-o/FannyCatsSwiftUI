# FannyCatsSwiftUI

The same iOS mobile app like https://github.com/solokha-o/FunnyCats , but written on SwiftUI.</br>
My experience with SwiftUI and WidgetKit lybrary.</br>
1-st part is the table with breeds of cats what load from API https://thecatapi.com</br>
You can choose the breed and see information of it in Wikipedia.</br>
2-nd part is a game "Guess cat". It have rule. You can see a cat on photo and have two answer about what breed of cat you see. It game have counter of right answers.</br>
3-rd part of app is the photo gallery of cat's breeds. If you choose a photo you can save it on your device.</br>
